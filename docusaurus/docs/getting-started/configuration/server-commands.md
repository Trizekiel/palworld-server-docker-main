# Palworld Dedicated Server Commands (RCON)

How to use Palworld Dedicated server commands to manage your server,
including Kicking, Banning and teleporting players.

## RCON

RCON is enabled by default for the palworld-server-docker image.
Opening the RCON CLI is quite easy:

```bash
docker exec -it palworld-server rcon-cli "<command> <value>"
```

For example, you can broadcast a message to everyone in the server with the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it palworld-server rcon-cli "Broadcast Hello everyone"
```

This will open a CLI that uses RCON to write commands to the Palworld Server.
